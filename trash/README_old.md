# Swarming Applications on Quadcopter DynamicsThis project implements various multiagent coordination techniques on Quadcopter dynamics, including:* Reynolds rules of flocking ("boids")* Olfati-Saber flocking* Starling flocking* Dynamic Encirclement * Heterogeneous Lattice formation using Pinning Control * Autonomous Assembly of Closed Curves* ShepherdingIt combines my previous work in the [swarming simulator](https://github.com/tjards/multi-agent_sim) with bobzwik's [Quadcopter_Simcon](https://github.com/bobzwik/Quadcopter_SimCon?tab=readme-ov-file).# MethodologyThe swarming techniques above are all implemented as high-level trajectory planners, assuming underlying double integrator dynamics. This resultant command signals, which take the form of accelerations in Cartesian space, are then converted into velocity setpoints for the quadcopters.The quadcopters make use of 3 nested control loops (translational velocity, angular position, and angular velocity) to track the desired trajectory.# DemonstrationsVideo of autonomous lattice formation using pinning control. Pins are shown in <span style="color:red"> red </span> and are recalculated for maximum degree centrality as the structure evolves.<p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation3D_quad_20_01.gif" width="60%"></p># References 1.
