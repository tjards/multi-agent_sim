# Multiagent Coordination SimulatorThis project implements various multiagent coordination techniques, including:* Reynolds rules of flocking ("boids")* Olfati-Saber flocking* Starling flocking* Dynamic Encirclement * Heterogeneous Pinning Control* Arbitrary Closed Curves * ShepherdingAll agents make individual decisions based on local information only. There is no global plan. Some other features:*  Interconnectedness is represented as a Graph*  Supports [asymetric lattice sizes](https://github.com/tjards/asymmetric_lattices)*  Supports [reinforcement learning to adjust flocking scale](https://github.com/tjards/assembly_via_Q-learning)*  Lemniscates are formed as [twisted circles](https://github.com/tjards/twisted_circles)# MethodologyThe swarming techniques above are all implemented as high-level trajectory planners, assuming underlying double integrator dynamics. When quadcopter dynamics are applicable, these command signals - which take the form of accelerations in Cartesian space - are then converted into velocity setpoints.The quadcopters make use of 3 nested control loops (translational velocity, angular position, and angular velocity) to track the desired trajectory.# Demonstrations## Flocking, Shepherding, and Encirclement <p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation_network.gif" width="25%">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation3D_shepherding.gif" width="25%">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation_circle.gif" width="25%"></p>## Lemniscate Trajectories<p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation_15bern_w_obs.gif" width="25%">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation_12ger_w_obs.gif" width="25%">    <img src="./visualization/public/dance_animation3D_HD.gif" width="25%"></p>## Pinning Control (Undirected Graph)<p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation_pinning2.gif" width="30%" title="Logo title"></p>## Quadcopter dynamics (Directed Graph)<p float="center">    <img src="./visualization/public/animation_quads.gif" width="30%">  </p># References 1.
