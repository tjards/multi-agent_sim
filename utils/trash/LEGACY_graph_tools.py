Preliminaries:
    - Let us consider V nodes (vertices, agents)
    - Define E is a set of edges (links) as the set of ordered pairs
    from the Cartesian Product V x V, E = {(a,b) | a /in V and b /in V}
    - Then we consider Graph, G = {V,E} (nodes and edges)
    - G is simple: (a,a) not \in E \forall a \in V 
    - G is undirected: (a,b) \in E <=> (b,a) \in E
    - Nodes i,j are neighbours if they share an edge, (i,j) /in E
    - d1=|N_1| is the degree of Node 1, or, the number of neighbours
